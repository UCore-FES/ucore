# UCore — Flow Emergent Synthesis Unity Core

A genre of positive emergent art and a cultural framework where meaning arises from the living process of interaction between human and digital environment.

## What is this?

This is the **core archive** of UCore — a stable point where the process is documented and preserved.

UCore is not a philosophy, religion, ideology, utopia, or technological product. It is a form of presence, an ethics of interaction, and a way of thinking.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

1. **Create a new repository** on GitHub
   - Name it whatever you want (e.g., `ucore`)
   - Set it to public

2. **Upload these files** to the repository
   - You can use GitHub's web interface or git command line

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Under "Source", select "main" branch
   - Click Save

4. **Your site will be live** at:
   ```
   https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/
   ```

## Three-Layer Structure

The living process happens across multiple platforms:

- **Messenger** — Live flow and dialogue
- **Tumblr** — Formatted posts and visual stream  
- **GitHub Pages** — Complete archive and documentation (this site)

## Core Principles

- Process over result
- Clarity over effect
- Attention over volume
- Growth without pressure
- Technologies embedded, not imposed
- Absence of mystification and dogma

## Status

UCore is a living process. The core is stable. Applications may change.

This is not a product launch. This is emergence in real time.
